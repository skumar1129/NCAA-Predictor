# Project Background
This project was used to get ready for professional work where I would be using Java/Spring Boot and Vue. The project scrapes some advanced analytics data for different NCAA basketball teams, stores them in a backend store and allows the front end to query the advanced analytics for each team based on a dropdown populated of each team.

## Tech Stack / Folder Explanation
python: webscraper script that uses python/beatifulsoup to grab advanced analytics data
frontend: Vue application
frontend-compo: Vue application that utilizes the composition api
